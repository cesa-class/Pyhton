# Pyhton
## Overview
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
## Pros <a name="FN1">1</a>
### Software quality
For many, Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality in general sets it apart from other tools in the scripting world. Python code is designed to be readable, and hence reusable.
### Developer productivity
Python boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically typed languages such as C, C++, and Java. Python code is typically one-third to one-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code. That means there is less to type, 3 less to debug, and less to maintain after the fact. Python programs also run immediately, without the lengthy compile and link steps required by some other tools, further boosting programmer speed.
### Program portability
Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms. Porting Python code between Linux and Windows, for example, is usually just a matter of copying a script’s code between machines. Moreover, Python offers multiple options for coding **portable graphical user interfaces, database access programs, webbased systems**, and more. Even operating system interfaces, including program launches and directory processing, are as portable in Python as they can possibly be.
### Support libraries
Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known as the standard library. This library supports an array of application-level programming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting.
### Component integration
Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a variety of integration mechanisms. Such integrations allow Python to be used as a product customization and extension tool. Today, Python code can invoke C and C++ libraries, can be called from C and C++ programs, can integrate with Java and .NET components, can communicate over frameworks such as COM, can interface with devices over serial ports, and can interact over networks with interfaces.
### Enjoyment
Because of Python’s ease of use and built-in toolset, it can make the act of programming more pleasure than chore. Although this may be an intangible benefit, its effect on productivity is an important asset.
## Cons <a name="FN2">2</a>
### Speed
Python is slower than C or C++. But of course, Python is a high-level language, unlike C or C++ it's not closer to hardware.
### Mobile Development
Python is not a very good language for mobile development . It is seen as a weak language for mobile computing. This is the reason very few mobile applications are built in it like Carbonnelle.
### Memory Consumption
Python is not a good choice for memory intensive tasks. Due to the flexibility of the data-types, Python's memory consumption is also high.
### Runtime Errors
Python programmers cited several issues with the design of the language. Because the language is dynamically typed , it requires more testing and has errors that only show up at runtime.
## Motivations
Here we're gonna see some pictures and statistical charts.
